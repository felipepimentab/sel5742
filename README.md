# SEL5742
Repository for the **Machine Learning** discipline

## Running locally 🚀
This repository uses the same Python virtual environment **venv** for all EPCs. The required dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. On MacOS, the environment can be created and set up with a single script:

#### Single script (MacOS 🍎)
```
sh init.sh
```

For other systems, this setup can be done manually with the following commands.

#### Create virtual environment
```
python -m venv .venv
```

#### Activate the environment
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
